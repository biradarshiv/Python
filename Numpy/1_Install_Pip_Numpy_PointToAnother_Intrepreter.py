NumPy stands for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects
and a collection of routines for processing those arrays.
Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed.

# Below steps are to install the PIP
Download the file from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder containing get-pip.py
python get-pip.py

# After installation check the version of PIP
pip -V
# pip 19.3.1 from c:\users\shiva\appdata\local\programs\python\python37\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.7)

# To install all the libraries in one go for all users on the system
python -m pip install numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose
# I have executed the above line of code
# to install for a particular user use the command
python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose

# to install the libraries individually use the below commands
python -m pip install  numpy
python -m pip install  scipy
python -m pip install  matplotlib
python -m pip install  ipython
python -m pip install  jupyter
python -m pip install  pandas
python -m pip install  sympy
python -m pip install  nose

# Running the one line command has installed all the below packages

# Python Interpreter as part of Pycharm
C:\Users\Shiva\PycharmProjects\One\venv\Scripts\python.exe
# Python Interpreter as part of installation
C:\Users\Shiva\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\python.exe

# Have a python interpreter already installed in my system
With above commands the interpreter in my system has installed all the latest packages / libraries
Hence pointing the Interpreter to use the one available in my system, rather than using the Pycharm-Python interpreter.

File -> Settings -> Project -> Project Interpreter -> Add New -> Select the python file available in my system.
This will Reindex and Rebuild the skeleton to use the latest libraries
